To some extent the potential (note potential)  for objectivity by the celibate counselor can be an advantage in pre- and post marriage counseling.

If one is a \"directive\" style one is simply stating the role, relationship and specific denominational obligations of marriage. If one is \"non-directive\" one is ensuring that the parties are informed and that it is effectively mediated between the parties so that they arrive at a mutual conclusion. So the criterion is professionalism not whether one is married or single.
