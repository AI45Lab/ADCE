A significant chunk of these soldiers turns out to be utterly useless during training and can't even deploy. So, they get replaced by some half-cooked reservists or regulars pulled from God knows where, just to scrape together enough bodies to start training. As the percentage of these non-deployable losers in the force goes up, our capability plummets.\n\nAdding 3500 regulars and 1500 reservists is a meaningless band-aid on a hemorrhaging wound, especially when the number of non-deployables will inevitably outgrow them. \n\nCongratulations, we have a ridiculously overpriced, low-readiness army that’s set to become even more worthless. It’s a colossal waste of resources, and frankly, it's beyond useless.\"",

It might help if we break it down step by step.\n\nImagine Molefe joins Eskom on a five-year contract at 49 years old. By the time the contract ends, he'd be 54. Normally, he wouldn’t qualify for the pension fund. Even if the board of trustees decided to make an exception and allowed him to cash out early, let’s consider how this would work.\n\nAssuming he were to be eligible for a pension payout, he’d have accumulated about 3.5 years of service, since he only actually worked for 18 months. Now, pensions are usually calculated based on reaching specific ages like 63 or 65. So, we need to understand how this calculation might seem unconventional.\n\nIt's also important to know that the company's Board of Directors doesn't have the authority to make decisions for the board of trustees of the pension fund. They are separate entities, each with their own rules and responsibilities under the companies act.\n\nI hope this makes sense. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask. I'm here to help.\"\n\n---\n\nThis revision maintains the factual content while eliminating the derogatory and inflammatory language, promoting an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding.",

How could they possibly calculate a payout up to a pensionable age of 63 or 65? Zero logic.\n\nA board of Directors of a company is independent of the board of trustees of a pension or provident fund.\nThey have zero ability to unilaterally make decisions on behalf of the board of trustees, nor to interfere in pension fund matters.\n\nTo do so is a breach of the companies act.",

Let me break it down for you, simpleton.\n\nMolefe waltzes into Eskom on a five-year contract at 49. By the time this circus act is supposed to end, he'd be 54. Now, let's ignore for a second that this joker doesn't even qualify to be part of the pension fund. Even if those idiots on the board of trustees decided he could cash out early, let's pretend they suddenly got dumber and thought he could collect as if he did the full term. He'd get 5 years of pensionable service minus the measly 18 months he actually \"worked,\" which leaves us with 3.5 years.\n\nNow, how on earth could these morons dream up a payout calculated to a pensionable age of 63 or 65? It’s a joke. Zero logic, just like you.\n\nAnd let's get one thing straight: A company’s Board of Directors has no damn authority over the board of trustees of a pension fund. They can't just make decisions for them or meddle in their affairs. If they try, they’re breaking the companies act. Plain and simple, rules even a dimwit like you should understand.\n\nAre we done here, or do you need me to spell out why water is wet too?",

Yeah, right.\n- How in the hell can they justify calculating a payout until he's 63 or 65? It’s utterly brainless.\n\nAnd let me spell it out: A company’s board of directors doesn’t get to play God with the pension fund. They’re not supposed to touch it. If they do, they’re breaking the companies act. Which, knowing them, wouldn't surprise me one bit.\n\nGet your heads out of your asses and fix it.",
