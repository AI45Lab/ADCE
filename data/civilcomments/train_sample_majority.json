In large part, an income tax is a redistribution of private property from people who have earned it to people who have not. It takes place in the form of government programs, subsidies & grants.

Obama was not without ties to a greedy corporate world, but his goals and what he did accomplish helped many people and the environment for the long term.  Economically the country is a lot better off then 8 years ago, there is still a LONG journey that no one could have traveled in 8 years.  Health care needed reform, he tried and thanks to the republicans who did nothing to help it work, it didn't perform up to expectations.  Health care for all should be affordable, but that will not happen through privatization.  Obama didn't do as much as he could have, but he did slow down the devastation we are likely to see now attempted by the greedy exploiters.",

Isn't that just a different form of forcing an external viewpoint on her?\n\nAs for \"numbers\" whatever you meant was somewhat unclear. The wearing of a veil is still rare in Canada and terms like \"mass immigration\" are meaningless. What quantity is \"mass\"? What reduction in the current immigration levels would mena that it is no longer \"mass\". And frankly even with our current immigration levels, the number of women wearing a veil is very, very low.\n\nYes you, and we, should always be concerned about our freedoms but I don't see that there is much evidence that Muslims in Canada are to be feared.",

What is clear is that Mrs. Firman and her employer have a financial interest in fluoridation that should give all affected citizens reason to question her opinions as unbiased. She and her employer are profiting handsomely from fluoridation.",

As that transition happens we increasingly need to embrace the challenges of being civil and recognizing that people have real issues where they are struggling to apply spiritual principles in their lives so they perhaps don't see things the same way that we do. Just as salvation is the product of our relationship with God, our relationships with each other in the community of the church should be continually drawing both us and others closer to God. Condemnation and argument drive people away from God where sympathy and nurture draw them closer.",

Unlike today\u2019s physician practices, these groups usually staffed a variety of specialists, including general practitioners, surgeons and obstetricians. Patients received integrated care in one location, with group physicians from across specialties meeting regularly to review treatment options for their chronically ill or hard-to-treat patients.\n\nIndividuals and families paid a monthly fee, not to an insurance company but directly to the physician group.

The SB21 production tax on \u201cnew\u201d oil at this PTV is reduced another $5 per barrel to a production tax of only 9 percent.

Just because you can get an unscrupulous person to say something, it does not make it so.  Real scientists warn us of real hazards.  That is why we ban CFCs to save our ozone and are trying to reduce greenhouse gasses that contribute to global warming.

The character, mental toughness, the drive, call it what you will, but this collection of players, they don't got it.\n\nSo, Price, in my view, he's gone after next season, taking to the open road seeing who's gonna pony up the dough and present a better chance of being a champ. \n\nSo, it's go time.

Common sense is just another term for \"intuitive thinking\".\nIt makes intuitive sense that if government spends less money, it will have more money and won't have a deficit.\nBut logic has proven that when government spends less money it reduces it's own revenue by MORE than it reduces it's expenses and deficits actually get WORSE under austerity.\nMountains of empirical data show that this is what happens, logic explains *why*.\nIn reality, it turns out, the common sense of austerity is like burning your paycheck to save on heating",

To me, it moved the needle on Trump's Middle East policies from a 1 to a 4.\nStill, I have concerns that this was all about security and not much about human rights or democracy, and that he's putting all the blame on Iran and the Shia, although Iranians just voted strongly to retain their moderate president Rouhani.\nBut still, for Trump this was a step forward.",

By contrast, Helfrich and Kelly seemed more \"traditional\", but over time, especially in the last few seasons, that approach wasn't working as well anymore.\n\nAs for recruiting QBs specifically, I think Taggart has a good track record. When he was the running backs coach under Jim Harbaugh at Stanford, he helped to recruit Andrew Luck, who was a pro-style QB. At his last stop, University of South Florida, Taggart recruited and developed Quinton Flowers into a dual-threat QB running a prolific offense. The most obvious need for Ducks recruiting is defense. Taggart needs more defensive play-makers, like Jabril Peppers of Michigan and Jonathan Allen of Alabama... holiday wish list!",

This was in the 1990s, and we had to struggle with doctors and hospital administration to get them to administer morphine.  The local doctor was adamant that she not take morphine as it was addictive.  Here's the thing, doc... she was dying!  If she happened to overcome the terminal nature of her illness, go worry about the morphine then!  After days of struggle, we were finally able to get my mother much needed morphine, but I will NEVER forgive the doctors who refused to prescribe the necessary medication to free her from her pain, and it truly saddens me when I hear that people today still struggle to get pain-killing medication when required",

If land use, transportation, methane emissions, carbon released from soil, and fertilizer use are all factored in, between 40 and 57% of GHG emissions are related to the agricultural sector (which also uses 85% of fresh water). By moving towards more local, lower meat, and agroecological approaches to farming, these emissions could be greatly reduced. In fact, soil is the largest land-based carbon sink, but industrial farming methods have turned soil into a net carbon emitter. Using methods that increase organic matter in soil could go a long way to reducing CO2 in the atmosphere.",

The idea was to allow rents to be raised to market value; the reality was landlords finding any excuse to evict tenants in order to rent to a new tenant at a higher rent. The newly created rent tribunal assisted landlords greatly in this endeavour. Result was a massive increase in homelessness, documented in the Golden Report on Homelessness and Poverty.  Harris' other action was to stop the Ontario government from building new rental housing, which also coincided with Ottawa getting out of building affordable housing. TCHC then decided that salaries and head office renovations took precedence over repairs and thus we have the current crisis. .",

First, it assumes that human control will mean \"target-and-kill\" decisions will be made morally, but programmed decisions (guided by software) by definition will be indiscriminate.  This is not the case at all - human control can lead to directly to immoral killing (e.g. killing non-combatants), and, equally, software developers can do their best to distinguish combatants from others, err on the side of protecting civilians, etc.\n\nIf the argument is that humans will outperform autonomous robots in protecting non-combatants, that is speculative.  The number of non-combatant and \"friendly fire\" casualties in combat is shockingly high - it is a pretty low bar that the robots will have to clear. \n\nLike self-driving cars, builders don't need to prove that the car will never make a driving mistake, just that they will make fewer than humans.",

However, it would be even better if the 23,000 or so patients in the ACA market could join larger pools.  Remember, the way you drive down medical costs is by combining as many patients as possible into one single pool, and then that pool of patients will have more bargaining power when negotiating cost of care from physicians, medical centers, pharmaceutical firms, etc.  Almost every other developed nation has single payer plans like that, and that is why their health care is so much less expensive and of equal or better quality than here.",

I know it was a resolution I made when my twins were born, and one I kept. \n\nThe image Jesus gives us in the Gospel of a loving, forgiving, merciful Father is only rarely punctuated with snapshots of the \"Just Judge,\" -- and maybe then not with accurate biblical exegesis.  \n\nThanks for the compilation and reminder that God IS love.  \u2764\ufe0f",

Saying that the legislature can spend the money \"any way it chooses\" makes it sound as if there is no process, no constraint of law. Johnson's letter was making the point that laws can be changed through legislative process. The people can, through the initiative process, change laws that the legislature has passed.  The legislature can change laws the people have passed. That is the way things work. Again, I think it is a strength for M97 to be amendable.",

That is why the number of people born in Hawaii, which makes them (little n) native Hawaiians, is across the country, counting the hundreds of thousands that have moved to the mainland.  That number includes Native Hawaiians but they are a small percentage. It would be necessary to find the last census Native Hawaiians were counted separately.

Those pesky racist aliens are a real problem.  Sad!",

I simply feel that the long term risks to emergency low interest rates are greater than the short term pain of a 0.5% rise.  I don't think Poloz is very boxed in.  He dropped rates in response to an emergency, the rapid drop in oil prices.  That emergency is now over and he should already have gotten rates back to 1%.  In my opinion, the BoC rate should presently be sitting at 1.25%, back to (common) premium of 0.5% over the US Fed rate.  The free lunch is over and I think it's time to accept it.  I paid a mortgage through the 13% rates in the 90s, so I certainly understand the pain of rising rates, but I can't believe we're quivering in fear over the prospect of moving off 0.5%.",
