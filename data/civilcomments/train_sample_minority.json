The good priests and bishops are afraid to speak up, since they would be marginalized and victimized by their brother clergy. I believe that the majority of the leaders in the hierarchy do not have a personal relationship with Jesus. They are told to be obedient to the pope, not to Jesus, so they do not know Jesus as real in their lives. They ignore the command of Jesus to protect the innocence of children because the popes ignore Jesus and demand conformity to man-created rules.",

You may recall that very much like today's killings, Byran Uyesugi had ample opportunity to murder at least one other Xerox employee who, if memory serves, he happened to intercept on a stairway.

He had been with his partner for many years and naturally wanted to take advantage of the 1138 rights and privileges that come with civil marriage. That meant, of course, leaving St. Ignatius for fear of being fired for causing \"scandal.\" Thankfully, Kent landed on his feet in a much better place: the great Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine, which welcomed him and his husband with open arms. There he felt no fear of being fired simply for being married. He alluded to this in a New York Times interview back in 2011 though never came right out and said so, for obvious reasons.

The reality is that the negativity and social dysfunction caused  by outdated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases create contradictions in society that all but the most desperately deluded (clearly, still a fair number of Americans) can see for themselves. These changes are already underway and while people are free to choose their own ideas for themselves, however backward, society will be required to grapple with basic issues such as racism, violence against women, income disparity and freedom of conscience for EVERYONE, not just groups receiving special rights to dominate others such as people calling themselves \"Christians\" and the very rich.",

For all the other councils of history (20 of them) the Church turned inward on itself. This council was turned out to the world.\" JPII and BXVI brought the barque back into port ... the likes of Chaput want it to stay there, gathering barnacles until it sinks.

Most Christians also believe Christ will return at the end of the world. \n\nMuslims consider Jesus Christ to be a prophet \u2014 a messenger of God \u2014 and a messiah. However, they believe that Muhammad was the last prophet and he recorded the word of God verbatim in the Quran.\nNow all Christians are KKK or Neo-nazi members. Not all Muslims are terrorists.

When a Trump supporter defends those statements, they are defending racism and bigotry. I personally have not found many who will stand up against that rhetoric. I'd love to be proven wrong - but I only get people on here defending it or dismissing it.\n\nRacism and bigotry do not only take the forms of white supremacists. It can happen in much more subtle ways - such as defending statements like Trump has made. It's important to try and understand why these statements are harmful and to examine one's self for bigotry instead of thinking \"Oh I'm a good person so there must be a liberal conspiracy to make me feel like I'm not\".",

The Gospel teaches us that to understand your abuser is to forgive her or him. I believe that.

In Vancouver. In Toronto. In Victoria.\n\nThat held for decades. In the mid 1980s you could buy houses in Vancouver for under 100 thousand dollars.\n\nToday, with both parents working full time, the dream of owning a house is dead. \"All those Asians\" you mentioned have pushed little Vancouver houses to two million dollars a pop, dozens of times the average annual local income.\n\nSo let's take your logic further. At your preferred trajectory, small houses in Vancouver and Toronto and Victoria and Brampton and Richmond will cost 5 million dollars by 2020, and cost ten million dollars by 2024. Yay! That's awesome for local workers in Canada with young families, Sherry.\n\nYes, what a blessing for our economy...",

When pastors (and denominations) remove Jesus from the centre of preaching, make the study and understanding of the Bible irrelevant, and cherry-pick what is to be considered sinful (or won't discuss sin at all), people starve for spiritual nourishment. These congregations become primarily a social entity and invariably many, many cannot sustain themselves and close their doors. The crux of it is that people need to hear how only the God of the Bible, through Jesus alone, grants us forgiveness, gives us authentic purpose, meaning, love and a future with Him for eternity. When humankind develops its own solutions for these deep human needs apart from God, the solutions are invariably temporary and often harmful. If anyone reading this would like to know more about Jesus, here is a link for you. Thanks for reading my comment.\nhttps://peacewithgod.net",

He has paid over $70,000 in income taxes in 2016, and now expects to generate a $50,000 refund from the deduction.\nThe wife historically handles the investing. The CRA allows the contribution, but NOT THE DEDUCTION on the basis that she is carrying on an investment business  (she handles their investments outside the rrsp, does not work in the financial industry, and has been permitted to declare capital gains and dividends in the past, without problem).\n\n This seems impossible for a variety of reasons, but the CRA's logic is that if somebody does something with a reasonable expectation of profit, then that person is carrying on a business in the eyes of the CRA. The amount of time spent investing is a major factor. The courts have held the CRA's position, but not with respect to rrsps (prochuk v queen 2014).\n\nW T F",

You know what these would be great examples for - the upcoming Synod on Young People.  I'd encourage your friends to write things about this.  I believe there is supposed to be a website up there.  Also, I know that this is Morlino but what you described is misogynistic and beyond the pale.  A priest shouldn't be commenting upon a young woman's looks.  She should definitely report it to the chancery and if nothing happens, then I am sure that newspapers on campus would love to report on a priest commenting on a young women's looks not being feminine enough and how her main purpose should be to catch a man and start breeding.",

I'm pretty sure the species will survive, even if there's no church there telling us what to do, or not to do when it comes to sexuality.  I ALSO think that if we focus on love, (and the stuff I talked about in my post), much of this will work out.  What I mean by that is that by all accounts, being gay is not something \"contagious,\" or otherwise \"spreadable.\"  So whatever that normal/natural percentage of gays exist, that's not likely to change.  \n\nI don't have answers, but I'm pretty sure that the church's teaching on human sexuality jumped the tracks a LONG time ago.  Spreading a litany of prohibitions, fears, name calling, and discrimination does little to foster what's REALLY important in human relationships. And remember, it's DESIGNED to teach this to our kids.  Today, we pay the price of that. I think the church needs to focus on something MORE basic.",

The truth is in Acts, both in how the-early Jesus movement considered itself part of Judaism and in how it was persecuted by the priests (not the people). When you translate the Bible it becomes real and can be analyzed using scriptural scholarship, which is why the Church resisted translating so that everyone could read it. Knowledge is power, and the power shifted when everyone owns the story. This issue was dealt with in L.G. It is the height of being a reactionary to oppose her on this.

I believe it was indeed both, but the 'systemic' aspect was one which was based not on clericalism or conservatism, but on liberal sexual views about clergy and homosexuality which was and still is to a lesser extent, seeking to be the norm in the Church as opposed to traditional or conservative sexual approaches. And that's my point. Of course many chose not ot offend, but many do. Again, I say it: unless we accept that offending occurs because of errors in both conservative AND liberal thinking, agendas and approaches, the issue of clergy sexual abuse of both children and adults, will not be solved. I must admit that my emphasis is on abuse of adults and while there are definite parallels, there are also differences, especially in the general population of those who offend. Its a sweeping generalization but I have seen a trend in conservative clergy being child abusers, and liberal clergy being adult abusers. We have to address both.",

People often forget that in the sacrament of marriage the church teaches that the sacramental action happens between the hearts of the two individuals who are betrothing their love to each other, the priest being merely an incidental witness to publicly confer the church's blessing. The priest is therefore not \"confecting\" a sacrament that magically renders the couple married in the eyes of the church. \n\nThis is one of those instances where the church actually gets it right and has the wisdom and humility to accept that the real nitty-gritty is happening within people's hearts, not on account of anything the priests does. Now if only the church could accept the fact that that's just as true for gay people as it is for straight people. Acknowledgment of that would go a long way to begin the enormous task of healing the deep wounds the church has inflicted on a countless throng of gay people who remain part of the Communion of Saints.",

The letter supposedly told how Bush had lied or been untruthful in his flight records and his over all military service. \nTurns out that the letter was a FAKE! \nThe allegations made were false, and the source had not been vetted. \nThe letter was not checked out, the CO who supposedly written the letter was never interviewed, the source was a phony. \nThe \"FAKE letter\" was dated at a time when the computer/printer used had yet to be invented.\nDan Rather resigned or was asked to resign along with other members of his new team. \nThe \"blog\" where you read this trash is not a credible source.

That sense of being under attack, combined with the belief that the Church should be the primary and at times the sole arbiter of truth and salvation, resulted in a sense of the right and indeed the obligation to be the institution that ruled or at least ordered  society. That worked until the Reformation. Vestiges of this continue in this country in the attitude of the bishops that if a society makes decisions  counter to Church teaching, or if people are vocal in their disagreement with an aspect of those teachings, this constitutes a persecution. If you believe that it is your duty to ordain how society is, then any dissent is seen as persecution. Hence the Fortnight of Freedom and other manifestations of a siege mentality.",

When the Angel announced onto Mary of Jesus's birth, the nine months for the babe in utero wasn't at the speed of light. But the work of God bringing about His Salvific plan of justice through a Virgin full of grace. Working to save man from his sins, Not augmenting his DNA. Thus, to save all souls - including the German people and Adolf Hitler from sin. But catastrophically they rather felt they could become gods themselves/a super/master race through science/technology.",

To label physical assault a more \"serious\" form of assault is odd - actually, it's absurd and undermines the horrific nature of sexual assault/harassment and domestic violence.

One may dress such up with quotes from clergy that seem to favor the idea, but it doesn't change the fact that it does not impinge on what is Catholic beyond the fact that some Catholics may like it.\nThe story is categorized under \"blog posts\" so I suppose I shouldn't read any more into it than an opinion piece.\nI trust you are well.",

The CDHRI was developed as an oppositional response to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which prevails in the West and much of the rest of the non-Muslim world.

You combine this with his openness on female deacons and his praise for feminism in the Joy of Love and there is some progress being made, however slow. \n\nHonestly decades from now i think people are going to look back at Francis's papacy as the moment when the seeds of much needed changes were put in place.....whatever our current cynicism.",

Yes, there would be plenty of priests if priests could be married heteros. However, is the goal to simply have more priests or is the goal to have a Church that is holy and free of chauvinist structures? The children and grandchildren who have walked away seeking genuine spirituality will not return just because there are more priests. I walked away like four decades ago. I was DONE. Now in recent months I have declared myself a NONE. Women have second class roles in the Vatican's Church.  I do not consider myself second class. This petition, sadly, simply enlarges the male-only exclusive priesthood to include all males, furthering the oppression of all women by all men.\n\nThe bishop's letter illustrates the lack of procedures for listening to the people in the pews.",

Seventh-day Adventism could well make a name for itself, without having to change its name or abandon Revelation 14, by proclaiming the everlasting gospel that our salvation is not of our selves, and thus utterly reliable as Paul explains in Romans 8 \u2026 \u2018I am persuaded that \u2026 [nothing] shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u2019\n\nImagine that hope loose in the world.

It is the stories that resonate in the heart that get repeated, by and large, even if there are some literalists among those who listen.  As Karl Rahner noted (TI, v22, c13) revelation is continuing as the Spirit resonates through the hearts of those who listen.

I found the conditions abysmal with mentally ill inmates literally locked up in subterranean caves with bars. What's missing is the fact that the jails and prisons were recently overwhelmed by the numbers of persons with serious mental illness who were recently forced to be inappropriately discharged from hospitals by a recent ACLU lawsuit that emptied out the hospitals without community care. \nThere are too many other points of information missing to discuss here. Like where is the responsibility of community mental health services that prevent arrest and incarceration? How unrealistic are the standards of care? How adequate are salaries in a high-cost community? When did prisons replaced hospitals for persons with serious mental illness?",

I listened to his Orlando \"thank you speech\" and noticed his segment on being picked Time's \"Person of the Year\". That seems to have upset him. He then used his audience to confirm his thinking so as to deflect that it is only his concern.\nHe sets up the issue as one of being politically correct, being named \"Person\" rather than \"Man\" of the year.

Quite frankly; some men need to grow up, behave, and act like gentlemen.  The issue here isn't that women may falsely accuse men of sexual harrassment/assault, but rather that men's morality & social behavior (in general, not all men) has deteriorated over the past few generations and women (again, in general) have tolerated it.  I can't nor won't speak on behalf of women, but IMO if more women held higher standards for how men should behave in public and how men should treat women, than a lot of these issues would disappear as men eventually discover that they can't act classless and expect to get away with it and/or be attractive to women.",

I attend an Episcopal church now with many gendered priests. Yet sometimes I would like a pope who is a little infallible, since some Episcopal churches can change essentials too easily. BTW, Buddhists teach that their doctrine, even considered to be  a rather mobile skillful means, is indefectibe, i.e., cannot be overturned. We do long for some certitude, but that is better realized when the entire church functions in the presence of Christ. Which I take to mean acting in awareness of the indwelling Spirit of Christ.",

The act of faith becomes so much more real and astounding when the scene is rendered real in its sad brutality.  The utter pain of a mother experiencing her son's brutal execution.  The treatment of the master; the utter failure of the master's mission.  The immensity of the resurrection to follow.

Maimane's DA want's power and is willing to throw whites and coloreds (remember that if you attack Afrikaans our not attacking whites your attacks mostly coloreds as they are the primary speakers of Afrikaans) in front of the bus to get the votes he needs.\n\nHe himself said in parliament that the cANCer was his parents party, and that in his youth he too followed them, and now he is turning the DA into another branch of the cANCer.",

However, as I read your article and the comments that followed, I realized that that is what has happened throughout our Church's History before it has made important changes in itself.  From my observations, the central issue at present seems to be centered around bringing the Church into better relationship with people who are maturing in their spiritual life..allowing them to more freely explore who they are in God within the confines and structure of the Church.

The current disenchantment among independents (older whites) with the Democratic party is symptomatic of demographic shifts in the United States.

Everyone boarded, but departure was delayed because the co-pilot commuting from another airport had not arrived.  Everyone deplaned to wait for the co-pilot\u2019s arrival.  About two hours later, a gate agent announced his arrival and said re-boarding would begin soon, but it did not.  Passengers were angry and yelling at gate agents demanding reasons for the delay.  We finally got the answer.  The co-pilot\u2019s delayed arrival resulted in the pilot being awake too long to fly the plane under FAA rules.  That angered passengers even more and came close to rioting.  United ultimately found another pilot and the flight departed five or six hours late.     The flight was scheduled to return to LA from Honolulu with a load of passengers, but the delayed caused UAL to put those passengers on other airlines or in hotels for the night.  This debacle was costly to UAL, but the commuting continues.  Dumb, dumber, the dumbest.",

What makes this event so popular is the fact that EVERYONE is included and welcome to attend.  I would have hoped that the Toronto Parade, which has been going on much longer than Calgary's, would recognize the importance of inclusion more than anyone.

People who live in this state got the great outdoor to enjoy and play in but it come with certain risks. I feel super bad for the poor kid who got mauled to death. Just plain bad luck, being in the wrong place at the wrong time with a wrong bear. Then that geologist woman suffered the same fate the day after. Sad. Maybe what Mr. Precosky is saying is to understand the risk, take precaution and have fun.

Just this weekend a poor Sikh man washing his car in his driveway got shot by a man who told him to leave the country.  It is all so sad but the alt-reich feels free to act out its hatred since Trump's election.",

If you deny these people the ability to use their skillset for good legal ways, they will use them for bad illegal ways. That's the reality. I personally would like no one to have a checkered past, but just as the people who helped design the alcohol distribution network we use today after prohibition had connections to black market bootlegging, the marijuana industry will have a transition.",
