Five nominees with more legal baggage than a mobster convention, all in the first month! Let's not skip his little $100,000 New York \"date night\" a few months into his term.

The issues anti gay marriage advocates don't get is that heterosexual marriage was not about how our species is propagated, but about how property is passed down through generations.

It was about property—cold, hard cash—being passed down, and yeah, that meant women and kids were pretty much property too, just the way it should be. And let’s not even start on how different cultures ever-so-liberally \"interpreted\" marriage. That’s all quaint and irrelevant. Marriage has always been a male-dominated club, and now you idiots want to let just anyone in because some genius redefined the rules? Give me a break. It's not about love or sex, it's about maintaining a traditional structure. Changing hundreds of federal and state laws to fit your warped view of marriage is not just a headache—it's a disaster waiting to happen. You want the world to bend over backwards for your fantasy?

Here's the thing you mindless anti-gay marriage zealots fail to grasp: traditional heterosexual marriage wasn't about your precious family values or species propagation. It was all about ensuring property stayed within the hands of male oppressors. Sure, sexual propagation was involved, but only because women and children were male property until society finally pulled its head out of its ass. And let's not forget that various cultures didn't even have the same marriage concepts as our so-called 'superior' Western ideals. \n\nFace it—marriage is just a man-made vehicle to control people, primarily by men. Now we've simply evolved enough to understand that it's not about a pecking order of sexes but about genuine relationships, including those of same-sex couples. This isn't about kinky sexual acts; it's about people’s lives and love, something you clearly can't comprehend. So, yeah, changing over 1200 federal and state laws was never going to be smooth.
